        <h1>Week 4 notes</h1>
        <h2>Encapsulation</h2>
            <p>
                the inner workings are kept hidden inside the object and only the essential functionalities are exposed to the end user.
                ex. When you make orange juice you turn on the machine and don't really know how it does it but you know it comes out as juice.
            </p>
        <h2>Polymorphism</h2>
            <p>
                various objects can share the same method, but also have the ability to override shared methods with a more
                specific implementation.

                ex. The same juicer can be used with other fruits.
            </p>
        <h2>Static Methods</h2>
            <p>
                A static method is called by the class directly rather than by instances of the class.

                For example, the Dice class could have a method
                class Dice {
                constructor(sides=6) {
                this.sides = sides;
                }
                roll() {
                return Math.floor(this.sides * Math.random() + 1)
                }
                static description() {
                return 'A way of choosing random numbers'
                }
                }
                This method is called from the Dice class like so:
                Dice.description()
                << 'A way of choosing random numbers'
                Static methods are not available to instances of the class. So, in our example,
                the instances of Dice such as redDice and blueDice cannot call the static
                description() method:
                redDice.description
                << TypeError: red.description is not a function
                
            </p>
            
        <h2>Composition Over Inheritance
        </h2>
            <p>
                When you inherit from a class, there are many not needed methods. 

                If you want to use a particular method from a class, but it has lots of
properties and methods you don't need, then it would be preferable to just
'borrow' the method instead, as we saw in the last section. So, borrow the
banana method from the Gorilla class instead of inheriting the whole Gorilla!
banana = Gorilla.prototype.banana;
